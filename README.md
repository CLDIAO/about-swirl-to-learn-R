# about-swirl-to-learn-R
学习环境：R & Rstudio,经过多次实验发现安装时需要以管理员身份安装，后面的过程才会顺利。
软件安装完成后：

安装swirl包
> require(swirl)
载入swirl包
| Hi! Type swirl() when you are ready to begin.
> swirl()
| Welcome to swirl! Please sign in. If you've been here before, use the same name as you did then. If you
| are new, call yourself something unique.
| You can exit swirl and return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing the Esc key. If you are
| already at the prompt, type bye() to exit and save your progress. When you exit properly, you'll see a
| short message letting you know you've done so.

| When you are at the R prompt (>):
| -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...
| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
| -- Typing info() displays these options again.

| Let's get started!
